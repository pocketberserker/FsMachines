machines
========

Machines are demand driven input sources like pipes or conduits, but can support multiple inputs.

A port of this design to Scala and Haskell is available from runarorama/scala-machines and ekmett/machines

Runar's slides are also available from https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4588997/Machines.pdf
